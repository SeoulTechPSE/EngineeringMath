### 1.1 Definitions and Terminology

::: {.incremental}
-   A **differential equation (DE)** is <font color="red">an equation containing the **derivatives**</font> of **one or more dependent variables** with respect to **one or more independent variables**
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.incremental}
-   Notation
    -   Leibniz notation $~\color{blue}{\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}}$
    -   Prime notation $~\color{blue}{y''}$
    -   Newton's dot notation $~\color{blue}{\ddot{\,y\,}}$
    -   Subscript notation $~\color{blue}{u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0}$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Classification by Type

::: {.incremental}
-   **Ordinary differential equation (ODE):** $~$Derivatives are with respect to <font color="blue">a single independent variable</font>

    $$\frac{dx}{d\color{blue}{t}} + \frac{dy}{d\color{blue}{t}} = 3x + 2y$$

-   **Partial differential equation (PDE):** $~$Derivatives are with respect to <font color="blue">two or more independent variables</font>

    $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial \color{blue}{y}} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial \color{blue}{x}}$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Classification by Order

::: {.incremental}
-   The order of an ODE or PDE is the order of the <font color="blue">highest derivatives</font> in the equation

    $$\underbrace{\color{blue}{\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}}}_{\mathrm{highest\; order}} +5\left ( \frac{dy}{dx} \right )^3 - 4y = e^x$$

    $$\underbrace{2\color{blue}{\frac{\partial^4 u}{\partial x^4}}}_{\mathrm{highest\; order}} +\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = 0$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Classification by Linearity

::: {.incremental}
-   An $n$-th order ODE, $F\left ( x, y, y', \cdots,y^{(n)} \right ) = 0$, $\,$is **linear** in the variable $y\,$ <font color="blue">if $\,F$ is linear in $y, y',\cdots,y^{(n)}$</font>

-   An ODE is **nonlinear** if:
    -   The coefficients of $y, y',\cdots,y^{(n)}$ contain the dependent variable $y$ or its derivatives
    -   Powers of $y, y',\cdots,y^{(n)}$ appear in the equation *or*
    -   Nonlinear functions of the dependent variable or its derivatives (e.g., $\sin y$ or $e^{y'}$) appear in the equation
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Solution of an ODE

::: {.incremental}
-   Any function $\phi$, defined on an interval $I$ and possessing at least $n$ derivatives that are continuous on $I$, which when substituted into an   ODE reduces the equation to an identity
-   Interval $I$ can be an open interval $(a,b)$, a closed interval $[a,b]$, an infinite interval $(a,\infty)$, etc.
-   A solution of a differential equation that is identically zero on an interval $I$ is a **trivial solution**
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {.incremental}
-   The graph of a solution $\phi$ of an ODE is a **solution curve** and it is continuous on its interval $I$ while the domain of $\phi$ may differ from the interval $I$
-   An **explicit solution** is one in which the dependent variable is expressed solely in terms of the independent variable and constants
-   $G(x,y)=0\,$ is an **implicit solution**, if at least one function $\phi$ exists, that satisfies the relation $G$ and the ODE on $I$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Families of Solutions

::: {.incremental}
-   Similar to integration, we obtain a solution to a first-order differential equation containing an arbitrary constant $c$
-   A solution with a constant $c$ represents a set $G(x,y,c)=0$ of solutions, called a **one-parameter family of solutions**
-   An $n$-parameter family of solutions 
    $$G(x,y,c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_n)=0$$ 
    
    solves an $n$-th order differential equation
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Systems of Differential Equations

::: {.incremental}
-   Two or more equations involving the derivatives of two or more unknown functions of a single independent variable

    $$\begin{align*}
      \frac{dx}{dt}&= f(t,x,y)\\
      \frac{dy}{dt}&= g(t,x,y)
    \end{align*}$$

-   A solution of a system is a set of functions defined on a common interval $I$ that satisfies each equation of the system on this interval
:::

### 1.2 Initial-Value Problems - IVP

In an <font color="red">**IVP**</font>, we seek a solution $y(x)$ of a differential equation so that $y(x)$ satisfies **initial conditions** at $x_0$ 

::: {.incremental}
-   $n$-th order differential equation
    $$\frac{d^ny}{dx^n} = f\left ( x,y,y',\cdots,y^{(n-1)} \right )$$

-   Initial conditions
    $$y(x_0) = y_0, \;y'(x_0) = y_1, \cdots, \;y^{(n-1)}(x_0) = y_{n-1}$$
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

$$\begin{align*}
 &\Downarrow \\ 
 \frac{d\mathbf{y}}{dx} = \mathbf{f}(&x, \mathbf{y}), \;\;\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{y}_0
\end{align*}$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When solving an IVP, $~$consider whether a solution exists and whether the solution is unique

::: {.incremental}
-   **Existence:** $~$Does the differential equation possess solutions and do any of the solution curves pass through the initial point $(x_0, y_0)$?
-   **Uniqueness:** $~$When can we be certain there is precisely one solution curve passing through the initial point $(x_0, y_0)$?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Theorem 1.2.1** gives conditions that are sufficient to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a solution $y(x)$ to a first-order IVP

![](figures/ch01_figure01.png "Rectangular Region R"){height="25%," fig-align="center"}

. . .

-   <font color="blue">$f(x,y)$ and $\displaystyle\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ are continuous on the region $\,R\,$ for the interval $I_0$</font>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example:** $~$First-order IVP

::: {.incremental}
-   $y(x)=ce^x$ is a one-parameter family of solutions of the first-order DE $~y'=y$
-   Find a solution of the first-order IVP with initial condition $y(0)=3$

*Solution*

-   From the initial condition, $~$we obtain $3=ce^0$
-   Solving, $~$we find $~c=3$
-   The solution of the IVP is $~y=3e^x$
:::

---

**Example:** $~$Second-order IVP

::: {.incremental}
-  $x(t) = c_1 \cos 4t +c_2 \sin 4t$ $~$is a two-parameter family of solutions of the second-order DE $~x''+16x=0$
-  Find a solution of the second-order IVP with initial conditions
$~x\left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) =-2, \;x'\left (\frac{\pi}{2} \right)=1$

*Solution*

-  Substituting for initial conditions and solving for constants, we find $c_1=-2$ and $c_2=1/4$
-  The solution of the IVP is $~x(t)=-2\cos 4t +\frac{1}{4}\sin 4t$
:::

### 1.3 Differential Equations as Mathematical Models

::: {.incremental}
-  A **mathematical model** is a description of a system or a phenomenon
-  Differential equation models are used to describe behavior in various fields
    * Biology
    * Chemistry
    * Physics
:::

---

-   Steps of the modeling process

![](figures/ch01_figure02.png){height="40%," fig-align="center"}

---

**Example:** $~$Radioactive Decay

::: {.incremental}
-  In modeling the phenomenon, it is assumed that the rate $\frac{dA}{dt}$ at which the nuclei of a substance decays is proportional to the amount $A(t)$ remaining at time $t$ given an initial amount of radioactive substance on hand $A_0$
   
   $$\displaystyle\frac{dA}{dt} = -kA, \;A(0)=A_0$$
    
-  This differential equation also describes a first-order chemical reaction
:::

---

**Example:** $~$Draining Tank

![](figures/ch01_figure03.png "Water draining from a tank"){height="40%," fig-align="center"}

::: {.incremental}
-  Toricelli's law states that the exit speed $v$ of water through a sharp-edged hole at the bottom of a tank filled to a depth $h$ is the same as the speed it would acquire falling from a height $h$, $~$$v=\sqrt{2gh}$
:::

---

::: {.incremental}
-  Volume $V$ leaving the tank per second is proportional to the area of the hole $A_h$
  $$\frac{dV}{dt}=-A_h\sqrt{2gh}$$    

-  The volume in the tank at $t$ $~$is$~$ $V(t)=A_w h$, in which  $~$$A_w$ is the *constant* area of the upper water surface
-  Combining expressions gives the differential equation for the height of water at time $t$
  $$\frac{dh}{dt}=-\frac{A_h}{A_w}\sqrt{2gh}$$
